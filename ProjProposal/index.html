				<h1><center>Project Proposal</center></h1>

				<h2>Theme and Subject</h2>

				<p>I plan on creating a VR interactive short film that puts the user in a position of peer pressure. There will be four videos surrounding the viewer and each frame will have one actor, as if a group of friends were huddled around the viewer. They will be arguing with each other and asking the viewer to decide what to do. In order to make a choice, the viewer will be asked to click on either the friend who thinks they shouldn’t do the proposed idea or the friend that thinks they should. The videos that play next depend on this choice. The theme is very similar to the interactive Youtube videos where the viewer makes a choice and clicks on the video that plays next, navigating their own way through the story. </p>

				<p>The topic of the interactive video is college tuition. The viewer is debating whether to drop out of college or not due to tuition increase. The viewer’s surrounding friends can’t stand to see them go, so that come up with more and more drastic measures in order to make the viewer stay. Throughout the piece, the viewer always has the option to just drop out, which will end the game. However, if the viewer chooses to listen to their friends, they may end up trying to hack into the school system to try and get the viewer’s tuition rate down, stealing money from an ATM, or kidnapping the Dean in order to grant the viewer a scholarship. This piece will explore group dynamics and how grouping people together can escalate the situation to a point it wouldn’t normally get to with an individual. </p>

				<h2>Letter of intent</h2>

				<p>Instead of just making an interactive Youtube video, I would like to put the viewer in that space and feel surrounded by their peers. I think this adds another level of interactivity, and especially in a peer pressure situation, will increase the feeling of being closed in and pressured. I really want to make this piece because I am very interested in film and storytelling, but I also want to discover new ways to deeper immerse the audience into the story and really make them feel like they’re apart of it, rather than simply observing. I’m also very into film editing, and always wanted to do something thing where the viewer can decide if how long they look at someone’s reaction or the person who’s talking.</p>

				<h2>Scope</h2>

				<p>For this project, I will either need to film with 4 cameras or shoot with one camera, but make sure that the actor’s timing still works. After that, I will need to do some coding and make sure the viewer can click to make a decision and that the right video starts after the choice is made. </p>

				<h2>Research</h2>

				<p>2. The buttons are right where the the scrolling bar is, making it tough to actually click the buttons.</p>

				<p>3. The video goes on for too long before they actually give the viewer a choice, so it feels less interactive.</p>

				<p>5. This video was very powerful, quick, and to the point. I think this i a great video to keep in mind when making my project.</p>
