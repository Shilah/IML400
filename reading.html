<h3>Sesson 1:</h3>
<p>The reading, Aesthetics of the Internet, looked at the internet mostly as an interaction between the users and each others work. I really like the point that one person’s art is never independent once it’s been released into the online world. Most work becomes subjected to memes, spoofs, and whatever crazy new thing the internet has in store for it. It’s constantly changing and developing, and one day it might be the most popular thing on the internet while the next day it’s forgotten. This is something people all over the world are connected to and experience, and it results in shaping culture and the way people live their lives. In return, the internet is also shaped by the way people live their lives. It’s a very interesting concept that tends to go full circle.   I understand the point the author was making about the internet being not suited for a lot of the same information for a lot of people, the way a book would be. However, I think that it can be. There are a lot of the same information that is seen and shared on the internet. You can even find a lot of full books online. However, it does have the aspect of that information being shaped by those who have already seen it, such as commenters sharing their opinion on the subject.

Sesson 2:</h3> 
<p>The World-Wide Web Reading is a basic overview of how the web works and all of the things that make it come together. It describes what W3, HTML, and URIs are in an easy to understand way. It also states that the web’s design is still in progress and works even though it’s not necessarily the best idea out there. Similarly to the author, I don’t think the design of the web will ever really be done. It’s a collection of collaborative work that’s continently fluctuating and adapting to our culture and tastes. The author states that the Web is “a show ground for new developments in information technology.” I think that that is a good description of what the web is and really describes how people are always working to make the next best thing. </p>

<h3>
WireFrame Response:</h3> 
<p>Since my webpage only holds so much information on it, I wanted to create a simple design that was pleasant to look at and easy to understand. The intended audience is my class and teacher, who really just need to use it to easily get to my projects and reading responses. My webpage is pretty basic with the nav on top, and buttons that tell you to click on them and where they will take you. All the text is easy to see, all you have to do is scroll down to read it. The links let signal that they’re links by changing both color and size. </p>

<h3>
Session 5:</h3> 
<p>Many of the readings this week emphasized keeping a consistent and even simple design in order to create a more user friendly system. In order to make it more intuitive, it is important to offer feedback — such as changing the color of a link when someone hovers over it — and to make icons recognizable metaphors such as an image of a trash can to delete content. Good design tends to build off of older models and add their own style and twist to them. The readings stated that it’s important to make the user feel in control of the system rather than excepting what the system wants them to do or not do. Part of making this work is letting the user undo their actions and not allowing them to make a huge error. The most interesting thing that I learned from all this was that fast is not always better. Sometimes a slow movement can engage the user and teach them how to use the system in a better way.

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
